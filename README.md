# Expenses Tracker App

This project is a expense tracker application fully built with React. The account and database information was built with Firebase from Google, which enabled us to provide users with the ability to sign in with Google alongside classic e-mail/password authentication.

The Website is divided into three main pages:

-The Dashboard (Homepage)[Dashboard](#dashboard-page)

-The Expenses Page [Expenses](#expenses-page)

-The Settings Page [Settings](#settings-page)

Both a light and dark theme were also integrated into the design of the app, enabling users to select their preferred colour schemes, [DarkMode](#dark-mode). The app is also fully responsive to cater to different user devices, [responsiveness](#responsiveness).

## Sign in and Sign up

The sign in and sign up page are relatively similar in terms of design. Below is the sign in page which includes functionalities such as remembering user details for 30 days or resetting a new password – this will send an email to the user with the ability to update their current password.

The Google sign up button will prompt a pop-up with log in instructions.

## Dashboard Page

The Dashboard page provides a general oversight of a collection of user imported expenses, highlighting the variety of amounts spent (total, monthly and weekly), as well as illustrating daily spends over the course of the past month within a bar-chart graph. There are also recent expenses and recurring expenses highlighted within two separate tables.

## Expenses Page

This page allows the user to view all the details within each individual expense in a simple and easy to read table.
The table can be altered in two ways, either through the filters button which provides multiple filtering options, or through the search bar, allowing the user to navigate through their expenses as they wish.
Alongside the ability to create expenses, users can also edit or delete existing ones.

There is also an option to change the base currency for all expenses in a simple drop-down menu.

A form will open upon click of the create expense button, allowing users to input all the relevant information to generate a new expense.

To edit the details of an existing expense, a form with the relevant existing expense details will appear where these can be changed or deleted.

## Settings Page

The settings page contains the user information, whereby first name, last name and email are filled in based on the inputted sign up information. Users can also opt to add additional information in their date of birth, mobile number and even upload their own profile picture.

### Dark Mode

At the navbar there is a button that allows the users to switch between light or dark theme styling choices within the navigation bar.

The website is also responsive to different device viewport sizes.
